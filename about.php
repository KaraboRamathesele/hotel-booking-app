                    Many establishments offer live music or comedy
                    shows on their calendars. Some also host dances
                    or seminars for workers interested in furthering
                    their careers. Restaurant services are top notch
                    as well, with full menus available every evening.
                    Clearly, staying in a big city makes it much easier
                    to enjoy Elaine's Grand Hotel's many entertainment options.
